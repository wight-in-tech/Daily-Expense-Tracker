# daily_expense
This one is my college project just applying different things I learnt from youtube to build an App on my own.
My color choices are really bad , but the app is function .. I will keep updating color and theme I guess 

## What does it do?
well as of now, you can see summary of your weekly expenses , and compare your weekly expenses to other days in the week 
Also , I was really frustated for keeping a track on how much money I was borrowing from my friends and lending them , so similarly you will have different pages for borrowing and lending money , you can compare your spent money there as well

### Home Page
this one contains your weekly summary , and has bargraphs to let you compare between all of your different days expenses 

### Borrowed Page
this one contains information about the money that you borrowed from your friends or family or whatever .

### Lent Page
this one contains information about the money that you lent from your friends or family or whatever .
